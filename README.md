# Mahmoud Al Sous . Jarvis Consulting

I am a Computer Systems Engineerng graduate from Carleton University who is looking to kickstart my career in the software development engineering industry. I am currently training under Jarvis as a Software Development Engineer in order to get placed with a Jarvis Client in the future. Through my undergrad progra, I obtained strong programming skills, learned about Networking and Cybersecurity, and gained an understanding of the computer architecture. I am fascinated by the ever changing software industry because it is always allowing us to fix problems that impact our society for the better and I would like to use my problem solving skills to be involved in projects that improve our software systems.

## Jarvis Projects

Project source code: [https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_MahmoudAlsous](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_MahmoudAlsous)


**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_MahmoudAlsous/tree/master/linux_sql)]: Implemented a Linux Cluster Monitoring Agent that allows users to record and monitor the hardware specifications and resource usages of each node in a Linux Cluster in real-time, which are running on the CentOS 7 operating system. The tool was designed to keep track of these nodes by communicating through IPv4 addresses internally through a switch. This was tested using a virtual machine instance, which was created on the Google Cloud Platform. The data collected by the LCA Monitoring Agent is entered into a PostgreSQL database hosted by Docker using SQL queries, which the LCA team can use to provide reports for future resource planning. The system was managed using Git and the source code along with the assisting files are uploaded to a Github Repository that connected with the remote desktop through an SSH encrypted connection.

**Core Java Apps** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_MahmoudAlsous/tree/master/core_java)]:

## Highlighted Projects
**Automated Testing of CAN Bus Networks** [[GitHub](https://github.com/Mahmoud-hub/4th-Year-Project)]: Developed an automated tool using one class classification, a modern approach called Intrusion Detection, and a statistical methodology to test the security on CAN Bus systems. I have developed the testing software and was in charge of testing the framework on given data and recording the results."

**R-Tanks Mobile Controller** [[GitHub](https://github.com/Mahmoud-hub/SYSC-3010-RTanks-Project)]: Designed a tank shooter game that allows each player to use an application on their mobile device to control their tank. I developed the application through flutter to build an interaction between the app and the Arduino board on the tank. The app sends coordinates to the Arduino through UART Bluetooth which will allow the Arduino to control the servo motors installed on the tanks. I was also in charge of developing a database which connects to the IR sensors on the tanks to record when any tank is hit by the other for score keeping.


## Professional Experiences

**Software Developer, Jarvis (2022-present)**: Implemented multiple applications using the Agile methodology. Participated in organizing and leading daily scrum meetings with the developer team as well as scrum retrospective meetings to go over the last scrum period and how to improve the project. Throughout the development process, I used Java, Linux, Docker, SQL, and bash scripts to complete the projects. I was able to gain some team collaboration skills through using the scrum boards when managing the sprint backlogs. I was able to utilize and improve my problem solving skills by working on the tasks and coding challenges that are part of the projects. Most importantly, the development process ensured that I learned the core concepts of every technical aspect of the assignments and I was able to use my prior knowledge to help me complete the tasks.
